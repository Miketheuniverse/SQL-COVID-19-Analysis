# SQL-COVID-19-Analysis

This project focused on analizing the COVID-19 public dataset provided by Our World in Data. 

The dataset was split into two main tables, the Covid19Data and the Vaccinations dataset. A number of different queries were written to demonstrate different SQL querying skills including using the functions CAST, MAX, ROUND, NULLIF, ROUND, DESC, SUM, CASE WHEN and PARTITITION BY was used. Additionally, JOINS, temporary tables and a CTE and was created. 

Queries performed to answer the following questions:

1) Total Cases vs Total Deaths - Mortality Rate

2) Percent of Country Population that got COVID and Country with Highest Infection Rate

3) Country with the Highest death rate per population

4) Which country has the highest death count?

5) Which Continent had the Highest Death Count?

6) Global Cases for Each day

7) Rolling Count of people vaccinated

8) Rolling Count of people vaccinated - after each day what is the total number of vaccinated people written as CTE

9) Rolling Count of people vaccinated using a temporary table
